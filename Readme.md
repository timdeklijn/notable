# Notable

Simple application to create a markdown file in a notes folder with the current
date as a header. If the file already exists it is simply opened in `neovim`.

## TODO

* [X] Add to remote repository
* [ ] Open the notes in the correct folder. And when `neovim` is closed, go
  back to the original folder.
* [ ] Read configuration (path to neovim + path to notes) from a configuration
  file and not have it hardcoded.
* [ ] Add tests. This should be quite simple.
* [ ] Add fuzzy finder (either neovim or cli/bash)
